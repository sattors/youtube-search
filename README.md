### **Guide to Using the Provided YouTube Search PHP Code**

This guide explains how to use the PHP code you provided to search YouTube videos and get search suggestions.

---

### **1. Code Overview**

You will use the **`Youtube\Search\Video`** and **`Youtube\Search\Suggestion`** classes to perform two tasks:

1. **Search for YouTube videos** based on a query.
2. **Get search suggestions** related to a query.

The provided code uses the **YouTube Search** library to search for videos and suggestions without requiring any login or API key.

### **2. Code Explanation**

Here's the breakdown of the code:

```php
<?php

use Youtube\Search\Suggestion;
use Youtube\Search\Video;
use Youtube\Settings;

require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

// Search for YouTube videos
$youtube = new Video(new Settings(array()));
$results = $youtube->Search("test", length: 1, offset: 0)->results();
print_r($results);

// Get YouTube search suggestions
$youtube = new Suggestion(new Settings(array()));
$results = $youtube->Search("test")->results();
print_r($results);
```

---

### **3. Step-by-Step Breakdown**

1. **Initialize the Classes**:

   * The code uses `Video` and `Suggestion` classes from the `Youtube\Search` namespace.
   * `Settings(array())` is used to initialize the configuration for the search.

2. **Search for Videos**:

   * `$youtube = new Video(new Settings(array()));` initializes the video search class.
   * `$youtube->Search("test", length: 1, offset: 0)` searches for videos related to the query `"test"`, returning **1 result** starting from the first result (offset 0).
   * `print_r($results);` prints the search results.

3. **Get Search Suggestions**:

   * `$youtube = new Suggestion(new Settings(array()));` initializes the suggestion search class.
   * `$youtube->Search("test")->results();` retrieves search suggestions related to `"test"`.
   * `print_r($results);` prints the suggestion results.

### **4. How to Run the Code**

1. **Place the Code in a PHP File**:

   * Copy the provided code into a `.php` file (e.g., `youtube-search.php`).

2. **Run the PHP File**:

   * Open your terminal/command prompt.
   * Navigate to the directory where your `youtube-search.php` file is located.
   * Run the PHP script with the following command:

     ```bash
     php youtube-search.php
     ```

3. **View Results**:

   * The script will print the search results for videos and suggestions directly to your terminal.

### **5. Notes**

* **No Authentication Required**: This code does not require any API keys or authentication. It uses the YouTube search functionality without logging in.

* **Customization**:

  * You can change the search query from `"test"` to any term you want to search for.
  * You can also adjust the number of results (`length`) or set a different starting point for the search (`offset`).

* **Output**: The results will be displayed in the terminal, showing details about the videos or suggestions found based on your search query.

---

### **6. Troubleshooting**

* **Missing Results**: If no results are returned, double-check your internet connection or change the search query.

* **Error with `autoload.php`**: If you get an error about `vendor/autoload.php`, make sure you have the necessary dependencies loaded. The `autoload.php` file is usually created by Composer, so make sure the Composer setup is complete and the dependencies are installed if needed.

---

### **Conclusion**

You now have a simple PHP script that performs YouTube video searches and retrieves search suggestions based on your queries. You don't need to worry about authentication or API keys for this use case.

Simply adjust the search query as needed, run the script, and view the results!
